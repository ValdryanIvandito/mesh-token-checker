# Cardano Token Checker

This is my first attempt to try and learn the Cardano Web3 Mesh.js library. The goal of this experiment is to find and check whether a wallet has a token or NFT by searching for its name and policy ID.

Here is a reference [link](https://meshjs.dev/guides/nextjs) to the Mesh documentation that I studied. The code I made is a modification of the reference.

## Demo

To see how it works, let's watch the following video documentation.
