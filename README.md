# My first Try Using Mesh.js (Cardano Web3 Library)

This is my first experiment to try and learn the Cardano Web3 Mesh.js library. The purpose of this experiment is to find and check whether there is a wallet that has an NFT or token.

Here is a reference link to the Mesh.js documentation that I studied: https://meshjs.dev/guides/nextjs

The code I made is a modification of the reference above. To see how it works, let's watch the following video documentation.

## Getting Started


First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```
